# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in improving this project.

## Workflow
1) Fork the repo and create a feature branch
2) Make your changes with small, focused commits
3) Ensure the app builds and runs locally
4) Open a pull request with a clear description

## Guidelines
- Keep changes scoped and readable
- Prefer simple, well-named functions over large blocks
- Update docs if behavior or setup changes

## Local Checks
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
